# Nodal Forces From Uniform Pressure
Tested with CGX 2.20 / CCX 2.20

+ Static linear analysis
+ Uniform pressure applied to the upper face of various element shapes
+ Output of RF shows the resulting distribution of the load to the nodes
+ Solid elements must be used in order to separate support nodes from load-affected nodes. Otherwise nodal forces from distributed loads and support reactions would cancel out

The upper surfaces are loaded with a uniform pressure. 

| Parameter      | Value   | Meaning                                      |
| :------------- |  :----  | :-------------                               |
| `thi`          | 0.1     | thickness, z dimension in m                  |
| `tol`          | 0.01    | tolerance for location-based set definitions |


The parameters are defined in [solid.fbd](solid.fbd) using the `valu` command.

## Solid Model

The model contains linear and quadratic triangular and 
quadrilateral separate elements which are extruded in thickness direction. The lower side is fully constrained.
A uniform pressure of 100 Pa is applied to the top surfaces of the element (1 mÂ²), such that the resultant force is 100. The nodal forces can be read as % of the total force.
